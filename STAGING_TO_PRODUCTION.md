curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CALLSHIFT/FennelValidatorStaging/main/install.sh | bash
./setup-validator.sh
./validate.sh start

# Daily operations
./validate.sh status              # Check status
./validate.sh logs                # Review logs  
./scripts/health-check.sh         # Comprehensive health check

# Maintenance and learning
./validate.sh restart             # Practice restarts
./scripts/update-validator.sh     # Practice updates
```

### **Staging Success Metrics**
- [ ] 7+ days continuous operation
- [ ] Zero unplanned downtime
- [ ] All learning exercises completed
- [ ] Comfortable with troubleshooting
- [ ] Documented operational procedures

## 🚀 **After Staging: Production Considerations**

### **When You're Ready for Production**

After mastering staging validation, you may consider production deployment. Production validation involves:

- **Real Economic Stakes**: Your validator secures real value
- **Enterprise Security**: Professional-grade security requirements
- **24/7 Operations**: Continuous monitoring and support
- **High Availability**: Minimal downtime tolerance

### **Production Repository**

For production validation, see **[FennelValidatorProduction](../FennelValidatorProduction/)** *(under development)*

### **Key Production Differences**
- **Hardware**: Dedicated servers, redundant systems
- **Security**: Air-gapped key generation, HSMs, full encryption
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 alerting, professional monitoring services
- **Operations**: Incident response teams, change management
- **Documentation**: Complete audit trails, compliance requirements

## 📊 **Focus on Staging Success**

In staging, your goals are purely educational:

| Focus Area | Staging Goals |
