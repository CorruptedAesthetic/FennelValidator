# ðŸŒ± Fennel Validator - Beginners Guide

This guide is for people with minimal technical experience who want to run a Fennel validator.

## What is a Validator?

A validator is a computer that helps run the Fennel blockchain network by:
- âœ“ Verifying transactions
- âœ“ Creating new blocks
- âœ“ Maintaining network security

As a validator, you'll earn rewards for helping secure the network!

## Prerequisites (What You Need)

### Basic Skills
- âœ“ Opening a terminal/command line
- âœ“ Copy and paste commands
- âœ“ Following step-by-step instructions

That's it! The scripts handle all the complex parts.
