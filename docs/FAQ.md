# ü§î Frequently Asked Questions - Fennel Validator

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Q: I'm completely new to blockchain. Can I still run a validator?
**A:** Absolutely! Our setup is designed for beginners:
1. Download the repository
2. Run `./install.sh`
3. Run `./setup-validator.sh`
4. Run `./validate.sh start`

Follow the prompts - everything is automated and explained step-by-step.

### Q: How long does the complete setup take?
**A:** 
- **Download & Install**: 5-10 minutes
- **Configuration**: 5 minutes (answering prompts)
- **Initial Sync**: 15-30 minutes (blockchain download)
- **Registration**: 5 minutes (generating files)

**Total**: About 45 minutes to fully operational validator.

### Q: What are the minimum system requirements?
**A:** 
- **OS**: Linux, macOS, or Windows (with WSL2)
- **CPU**: 2 cores minimum (any modern computer)
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 50GB free space (SSD recommended)
- **Network**: Stable internet, port 30333 accessible

### Q: Is it safe for beginners?
**A:** Yes! Security is built-in:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic firewall** configuration
- ‚úÖ **File permissions** secured automatically
- ‚úÖ **No manual key sharing** - Fennel Labs handles registration
- ‚úÖ **Local-only RPC** access by default
- ‚úÖ **Safe defaults** for all options

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Q: Do I need to install anything before starting?
**A:** Minimal requirements (usually pre-installed):
- `curl` and `wget` for downloads
- `git` for repository cloning (optional)
- Internet connection

Our `install.sh` script handles everything else automatically.

### Q: Can I run multiple validators on the same machine?
**A:** Not recommended for beginners. Each validator needs:
- Unique ports (30333, 9944, 9615)
- Separate data directories
- Different validator names

Better to start with one validator and learn the basics first.

### Q: What if the installation fails?
**A:** 
1. **Check internet connection**: Download requires stable internet
2. **Run diagnostics**: `./tools/preflight-check.sh`
3. **Try again**: Most issues are temporary network problems
4. **Reset and retry**: `./tools/reset-validator.sh` then start over

### Q: How do I know if the installation worked?
**A:**
```bash
./validate.sh status
```
Should show "‚úÖ Validator is running" if successful.

## üîß Configuration

### Q: What validator name should I choose?
**A:** Pick something unique and identifiable:
- ‚úÖ **Good**: "Alice-Tech-Validator", "University-Blockchain-Lab"
- ‚ùå **Avoid**: Special characters, very long names, generic names like "Validator1"

### Q: Should I change the default ports?
**A:** For beginners, use defaults:
- **P2P Port**: 30333 (for connecting to other validators)
- **RPC Port**: 9944 (for local monitoring tools)
- **Metrics Port**: 9615 (for performance monitoring)

Only change if you get "port already in use" errors.

### Q: What's the difference between staging and mainnet?
**A:** 
- **Staging**: Learning environment, no real money, safe for testing
- **Mainnet**: Production network with real value (not available yet)

**Always start with staging** to learn validator operations safely.

## üîë Keys & Security

### Q: What are session keys and why do I need them?
**A:** Session keys are like your validator's ID card:
- **Generated automatically** during setup
- **Prove your validator's identity** to the network
- **Required for earning rewards**
- **Managed securely** by our scripts

### Q: Do I need to share my private keys with anyone?
**A:** **Never!** Our secure process:
1. ‚úÖ **Keys generated locally** on your machine
2. ‚úÖ **Only public information** shared with Fennel Labs
3. ‚úÖ **Private keys stay private** and secured
4. ‚úÖ **Fennel Labs uses admin powers** to register you

### Q: Where are my keys stored and how are they protected?
**A:** 
- **Location**: `validator-data/` directory
- **Permissions**: Read-only for your user account
- **Backup**: Copy this directory to secure storage
- **Protection**: Never uploaded or shared automatically

### Q: What if I lose my keys?
**A:** 
- **Session keys**: Can be regenerated with `./scripts/generate-session-keys.sh`
- **Stash account**: Can be recovered with seed phrase (saved securely)
- **Validator data**: Keep regular backups of `validator-data/` directory

## üåê Network & Connectivity

### Q: My validator shows "0 peers connected" - is this bad?
**A:** Yes, this indicates connectivity issues:
```bash
# Check firewall
sudo ufw allow 30333/tcp

# Restart validator
./validate.sh restart

# Run diagnostics
./tools/troubleshoot.sh
```

### Q: How many peers should I have connected?
**A:** 
- **Minimum**: 1-2 peers (validator will work)
- **Good**: 5-15 peers (recommended range)
- **Excellent**: 15+ peers (optimal connectivity)

### Q: Can I run a validator behind a firewall/NAT?
**A:** Yes, but port 30333 must be accessible:
- **Home router**: Forward port 30333 to your validator machine
- **Corporate firewall**: Request port 30333 outbound access
- **Cloud hosting**: Ensure security groups allow port 30333

### Q: Why does initial sync take so long?
**A:** Your validator is downloading the entire blockchain history:
- **Staging network**: ~2-5GB of data
- **Speed depends on**: Internet connection and network traffic
- **Progress**: Check `./validate.sh logs` for sync status

## üí∞ Rewards & Registration

### Q: When do I start earning rewards?
**A:** After completing registration:
1. **Generate keys**: `./scripts/generate-session-keys.sh`
2. **Complete registration**: `./tools/complete-registration.sh`
3. **Submit to Fennel Labs**: Send the generated file
4. **Wait for activation**: Fennel Labs adds you to validator set
5. **Start earning**: Once active in the validator set

### Q: How much can I earn as a validator?
**A:** 
- **Staging network**: No real monetary rewards (learning environment)
- **Future mainnet**: Rewards will depend on network economics
- **Purpose**: Focus on learning and contributing to network security

### Q: What information do I need to send to Fennel Labs?
**A:** Only public information automatically generated:
- Your validator's public address
- Session keys (public portion only)
- Validator name and configuration

**Never share**: Private keys, seed phrases, or passwords.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Q: My validator stopped working. What should I do?
**A:** Step-by-step diagnosis:
```bash
# Check if still running
./validate.sh status

# If stopped, restart
./validate.sh restart

# Check for errors
./validate.sh logs

# Run full diagnosis
./tools/troubleshoot.sh
```

### Q: How do I update my validator?
**A:** Simple update process:
```bash
# Stop validator
./validate.sh stop

# Update software
./install.sh

# Restart validator
./validate.sh start
```

### Q: Something went wrong. How do I start over?
**A:** Complete reset (keeps backups):
```bash
./tools/reset-validator.sh
```
Then follow the setup process again from the beginning.

### Q: How do I monitor my validator's performance?
**A:** Several monitoring options:
```bash
# Quick status
./validate.sh status

# Detailed information
./tools/validator-status.sh

# Real-time logs
./validate.sh logs

# Network health
curl -s http://localhost:9944/health
```

## üè¢ Advanced Questions

**A:** Yes! Cloud hosting is often better for validators:
- **Advantages**: Better uptime, faster internet, dedicated resources
- **Popular providers**: AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Oracle Cloud
- **Minimum specs**: 2 CPU, 4GB RAM, 50GB storage

### Q: Should I use Docker or run natively?
**A:** For beginners, our native setup is easier:
- **Native**: What our scripts use (recommended for beginners)

### Q: How do I backup my validator?
**A:** Essential files to backup:
```bash
# Create backup
tar -czf validator-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz validator-data/ config/

# Store securely
# Copy to external drive, cloud storage, etc.
```

### Q: Can I migrate my validator to a different machine?
**A:** Yes, with careful steps:
1. **Stop old validator**: `./validate.sh stop`
2. **Backup data**: Copy `validator-data/` and `config/`
3. **Set up new machine**: Install FennelValidator
4. **Restore data**: Copy backed up directories
5. **Start new validator**: `./validate.sh start`

**Important**: Never run the same validator on multiple machines simultaneously!
