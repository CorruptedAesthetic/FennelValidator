  ./scripts/health-check.sh
  ```
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: Successfully update validator software without downtime

#### **Exercise 3.2: Performance Monitoring**
- [ ] **Goal**: Understand validator performance characteristics
- [ ] **Time**: 45 minutes
- [ ] **Steps**:
  ```bash
  # Monitor system resources
  top -p $(pgrep fennel-node)
  
  # Check memory usage over time
  free -h
  ps aux | grep fennel-node | awk '{print $6}'
  
  # Monitor block production participation
